          <Tool title="14” MacBook Pro, M2 Pro, `16GB RAM (2023)">
            I was using the the Zephyrus G-14 with WSL 2 prior to this and I
            find the MacBook Pro to be a much more powerful machine for
            development. I’ve never heard felt it stutter or lag, even when I
            code in large TypeScript projects.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title={`Dell 27" QHD Monitor`}>
            Really nothing special. I find that 1440p is the minimum resolution
            for a good display experience. At 27&quot; 1440p is sharp enough for
            me.

          <Tool title="Keychron Q1 Keyboard">
            I’m a big fan of custom keyboards, and I use them whenever I can.
            The Q1 isn’t the fanciest custom keyboard out there but I’ve done a
            few things with it to make it sound and feel nicer. I used the force
            break and tape mod’s to eliminate some of the ping that early Q1
            models had.

          <Tool title="Razer Orochi V2 Mouse">
            I love the Razer Orochi. It’s the mouse I use the most because it is
            lightweight, ergonomic, and portable. It has a fantastic pulling
            rate and feels great to use with the 2.4GHz dongle. I also think the
            design is fantastic.

        <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
          <Tool title="VSCode">
            Yeah I know it’s basic to use VSCode but I don’t really care. I keep
            my setup pretty minimal and I usually turn off all the distractions
            in my IDE to keep it as minimal as possible.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Terminal">
            The macOS terminal suits my needs and I don’t see the need to use a
            different terminal emulator.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Chrome">
            Google Chrome is still the most popular web browser so it’s what I
            use to test my web apps most of the time.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="WSL 2">
            I use WSL 2 when I am stuck with Windows primarily because Linux is
            much more powerful for development than Windows.
          </Tool>
        </ToolsSection>
        <ToolsSection title="Design">
          <Tool title="Figma">
            I started using Figma as just a design tool but now it’s become my
            virtual whiteboard for basically everything. Never would have
            expected the collaboration features to be the real hook.

        <ToolsSection title="Software">
          <Tool title="Mac Mouse Fix">
            It’s no small secret that macOS is terrible with mice. I’m not sure
            if Apple is trying to sell more Magic Trackpads or something but the
            default mouse experience is pretty terrible. Luckily Mac Mouse Fix
            exists and fixes pretty much any issue I have with how my mouse
            behaves.

        <ToolsSection title="Productivity">
          <Tool title="Raycast App">
            Raycast is a lot more than just better spotlight app. I enjoy using
            it for it’s amazing extensions and shortcuts. I haven’t used it for
            any AI tools yet but I enjoy the productivity aspect of it.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Notion Calendar">
            I like notion calendar because it syncs with my Google Calendar and
            it can run in the background to make sure I don’t miss any events.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Cal.com">
            Amazing open source tool for scheduling meetings while protecting my
            calendar and making sure I still have lots of time for deep work
            during the week.
          </Tool>
          <Tool title="Affinity Photo 2">
            Remember when Adobe Photoshop was a one time purchase? Now it’s
            crazy expensive. I don’t need photo editing tools that often anymore
            but when I do I reach for Affinity Photo 2. I have really enjoyed
            using it so far and the price is very reasonable.
